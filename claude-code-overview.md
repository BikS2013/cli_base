---

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Node.js 18+**  
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
   > **Note:**  
   > - Do **not** use `sudo npm install -g` as it may cause permission issues and security risks.  
   > - If you encounter permission errors, refer to the [configuration guide](#configure-claude-code) for recommended solutions.

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**  
   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory
   ```

3. **Start Claude Code**  
   Launch Claude Code by running:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

4. **Authenticate**  
   Complete the one-time OAuth process with your Console account. Active billing is required at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).

## Key Features

Claude Code operates directly in your terminal, providing the following capabilities:

- **Editing and Debugging**: Edit files, fix bugs, and refactor code across your codebase.
- **Code Understanding**: Answer questions about your code’s architecture, logic, and functionality.
- **Testing and Linting**: Execute and debug tests, lint code, and resolve issues.
- **Git Integration**: Search git history, resolve merge conflicts, and create commits or pull requests.
- **Automation**: Automate CI workflows and infrastructure tasks.

---

## Research Preview
Claude Code is in **beta** as a research preview. Anthropic is actively gathering developer feedback to improve the tool’s reliability, support for long-running commands, terminal rendering, and Claude’s self-awareness of its capabilities.

### Reporting Bugs
Report bugs using the `/bug` command or through the [GitHub repository](#).

---

## Before You Begin

### Troubleshooting WSL Installation
Claude Code does not run directly on Windows and requires WSL. If you encounter issues:

#### Common Errors and Fixes
- **OS/Platform Detection Issues**:  
  If WSL uses Windows npm, run:
  ```bash
  npm config set os linux
  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check
  ```
- **Node Not Found Errors**:  
  If `exec: node: not found` occurs, ensure your WSL environment uses Linux Node.js. Confirm paths with:
  ```bash
  which npm
  which node
  ```
  Paths should start with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. Install Node.js via your Linux distribution’s package manager or `nvm`.

---

## Core Features and Workflows

### Security and Privacy by Design
Claude Code ensures your code’s security through:
- **Direct API Connection**: Queries go directly to Anthropic’s API without intermediate servers.
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains awareness of your project structure.
- **Actionable Operations**: Performs real operations like editing files and creating commits.

### Example Commands
#### Ask Questions About Your Codebase
```bash
claude
> how does our authentication system work?
```

#### Create a Commit
```bash
claude commit
```

#### Fix Issues Across Multiple Files
```bash
claude "fix the type errors in the auth module"
```

## Memory Management

Claude Code can remember preferences across sessions. Memory is stored in the following locations:

| Memory Type            | Location             | Purpose                              |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Project Memory**     | `./CLAUDE.md`       | Team-shared conventions and knowledge. |
| **Local Project Memory** | `./CLAUDE.local.md` | Personal project-specific preferences. |
| **User Memory**        | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Global personal preferences.         |

### Adding Memories
Use the `#` shortcut to quickly add memories:
```bash
# Always use descriptive variable names
```
You’ll be prompted to select the memory file to store this in.

### Tips to Reduce Costs
- Use `/compact` to reduce conversation size.
- Write specific queries to avoid unnecessary scanning.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller interactions.

### Troubleshooting WSL Installation

Currently, Claude Code does not fully support Windows native environments. To use Claude Code on Windows, install **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** and set up a compatible Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04). Follow these steps:

1. Install WSL:
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
     ```bash
     wsl --install
     ```
   - Restart your computer if prompted.

2. Set up Ubuntu:
   - Launch the installed Ubuntu distribution from the Start menu.
   - Follow the prompts to create a user account and password.

3. Install required dependencies:
   - Update package lists:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```
   - Install Node.js, git, and other dependencies:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nodejs git ripgrep
     ```

4. Verify installation:
   - Check Node.js version:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - Check git version:
     ```bash
     git --version
     ```
