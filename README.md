## Usage

The CLI tool follows this general structure:

```
cli-tool [COMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND] [OPTIONS] [FLAGS]
```

### Core Commands

- `config`: Manage configuration files (global, local, named)
- `llm`: Manage LLM profiles
- `schema`: Display command structure as ASCII art
- `help`: Display help information

### Configuration Management

The tool supports three levels of configuration files:

1. **Global**: System-wide settings stored in `~/.cli-tool/config.json`
2. **Local**: Project-specific settings stored in `./.cli-tool/config.json`
3. **Named**: User-specified configuration files at any location

Configuration actions include:

```bash
# Show content of the local configuration file
cli-tool config show --local

# Save current parameters to global configuration
cli-tool config save --global

# Import configuration from another file
cli-tool config import --from-file "~/my-configs/special.json" --to-local
```

### LLM Profile Management

Create and manage LLM profiles:

```bash
# Create a new LLM profile
cli-tool llm create --name "gpt4-standard" --provider "openai" --model "gpt-4" --api-key "key123" --temperature 0.7 --global

# List all LLM profiles
cli-tool llm list --global

# Show a specific profile
cli-tool llm show --name "gpt4-standard"

# Set a profile as default
cli-tool llm use --name "gpt4-standard"
```

### Schema and Help

View the command structure and get help:

```bash
# Show schema
cli-tool schema show

# Get detailed help
cli-tool help
cli-tool help config
cli-tool help llm create
```

## Use it as template for CLI tools 
To use it as template for other CLI tools, you have to fork the repo.
You can perform manually the various changes as are described in the tool?adaptation_guide.md or ask from an LLM to do it. 

If you want to use **Claude Code** you can try the following command: 
``` 
I want you to read the tool_adaptation_guide and follow the instructions to rename the tool from cli-base to
getPage without adding any additional logic.
I donâ€™t want you to install the package at all. 
Just make the changes.
``` 

After the changes have been made you have to run 
```bash 
uv sync 
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```
